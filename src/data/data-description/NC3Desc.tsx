        <b>Alex</b> came to St. Petersburg at the weekend and offered Tais (5'7" / 132 lb) and <b>Natalia
        Mysik</b> (5'11" / 154 lb) to hold a mixed tournament on beach wrestling. He had been practicing
        wrestling a lot recently, and had become physically stronger - 5'9" / 150 lb, which allowed him to count
        on a successful performance.
      </p>
      <p>The mixed beach tournament went in three rounds. The fights between the girls were hard enough,
        especially in the first two rounds. The mixed contests started with Alexâ€™s convincing win over Natalia .
        Then the luck turned away from Alex ...</p>
      <p>If you like <b>mixed competitive wrestling</b>, then we believe you will love our film. Watch how
        everything was!</p>
