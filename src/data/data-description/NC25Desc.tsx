        This is the second video of the series titled "<b>Mixed wrestling - the best fights</b>". Here you can
        see <b>Villian</b> (5'7" / 177 lb) wrestle three strong female fighters: <b>Tais</b> (5'7" / 130
        lb), <b>Elena Vasilyeva</b> (5'6" / 135 lb), and <b>Lyudmila</b> (5'11" / 154 lb).<br/>
        Each of these ladies presents a unique challenge: tall blonde Lyudmila, a newcomer in competitions, is engaged
        in Muay Thai; strong and ambitious Elena competes successfully in arm wrestling, submission grappling, and MMA;
        and Tais, the strongest and most experienced fighter among them.
      </p>
      <p>This video features five submission grappling fights (Tais and Elena wrestled Villian twice). The fights
        take place both in a gym on a mat and outdoors on a sandy beach and on grass. If you like mixed
        wrestling, then donâ€™t miss this video.</p>
